              If you choose one of our standard products from the offering, the completion time for a modular house
              would be 10 to 14 weeks. If changes are made or a custom-designed project is ordered, the timeline may
              slightly increase. For private homes, the construction timeline from receiving the building permit and
              starting work on-site to the completed house is 4 to 6 months, depending on the chosen project.
